QS- Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

Population Analysis of States/UTs in India
This project analyzes the population data of states and union territories in India, focusing on urban and rural populations as well as the distribution of boys and girls.

Overview
The provided Python script uses the Matplotlib library to create bar charts visualizing the distribution of urban and rural populations, as well as the boys' and girls' populations for each state and union territory. The code reads data from a CSV file containing population statistics.

Files
Population_of_India.csv: This file contains the population data for states and union territories in India.
Population_Analysis.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for population analysis and visualization.
Dependencies
Python: The code is written in Python, and you need a Python interpreter to run the script.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: Used for creating visualizations, specifically bar charts in this project.
Usage
Install Dependencies:
bashCopy code
pip install pandas matplotlib
Run the Script:
Open and run the "Population_Analysis.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook.
Alternatively, copy the code from the notebook into a Python script and run it using a Python interpreter.
Explore Visualizations:
The script generates bar charts comparing urban and rural populations, as well as boys' and girls' populations, for each state or union territory in India.
Adjustments can be made to visualize data in different ways, such as absolute values, percentages, or other demographic metrics.
